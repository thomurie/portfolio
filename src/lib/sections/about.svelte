		<p>
			I'm a developer passionate about creating visually stunning, data-rich applications that blend
			simple interactions with powerful insights. My favorite work is delivering experiences that
			enable users to make meaningful decisions from complex data sets.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently a Fullstack Engineer at Dataro. I contribute to creating and maintaining
			frontend webpages and API endpoints that enable users to modify and utilize insights from
			machine learning models. I am also pursuing my Masters degree in Data Science.

		<p>
			In my spare time, I usually hack together a side project, hang out with my partner, or play an
			overly complex card game.
